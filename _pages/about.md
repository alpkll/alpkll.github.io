I am a Ph.D. student at **CEA (Commissariat à l'énergie atomique)** and **Paris-Saclay University**, with my thesis title **"Tensor Methods for Deep Neural Network Compression"**.

My research addresses the challenges of deploying large-scale deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices. Specifically, I investigate the joint optimization of **Tensor Decomposition** with other compression paradigms, including **Low-Bit Quantization** and **Structured Pruning**. My work aims to develop "compound" compression strategies that significantly reduce model complexity (parameters and FLOPs) without compromising accuracy.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from **Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier University**. My previous research at **IRIT & IMT** focused on the analysis of tensor-based parameter estimation for Gaussian Mixture Models in the large-dimensional regime.
