I am a Ph.D. student at **CEA (Commissariat à l'énergie atomique)** and **Paris-Saclay University**, working on **Tensor Methods for Deep Neural Network Compression**. My research focuses on developing novel tensor decomposition algorithms to reduce parameter count and FLOPs in deep learning models while maintaining accuracy.

Previously, I completed my Master's in Applied Mathematics at **Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier University** and worked as a Research Intern at **IRIT & IMT**, analyzing tensor-based Gaussian Mixture Models.

### News
* **[Dec 2025]** My paper *"Distribution-Aware Tensor Decomposition"* was accepted to **NeurIPS 2025**!
